# Hello, I'm Nisha    

## About Me  ðŸŒ±

I am an espresso-fueled software engineer based in NYC. I thrive on solving problems with code and love bringing ideas and designs to life, with a special passion for creating modern, intuitive digital experiences. I believe in thoughtful design that balances functionality and aesthetics. No matter the industry, a great user experience is always the priority.

When Iâ€™m not buried in a project, youâ€™ll find me lost in a book (The Good Earth by Pearl S. Buck is my all-time favorite!), exploring the outdoors on a hike, or capturing moments with my trusty Fuji camera. Whether itâ€™s on a nature trail or on Visual Studio, Iâ€™m always looking for the next adventure.
