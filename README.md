# Hello, I'm Nisha ðŸŒ±

## About Me

I'm a software engineer who loves solving problems with code, fueled by my daily dose of espresso. When I don't have my nose buried in a project, youâ€™ll find it buried in a book (The Good Earth by Pearl S. Buck is my favorite!) Otherwise, I'm exploring the outdoors on a hike, capturing moments on my trusty Fuji camera, or just disconnecting and taking a quaint walk. I love bringing ideas and designs to life, and am always looking for the next adventureâ€” whether it's on foot, or on VisualStudios!
