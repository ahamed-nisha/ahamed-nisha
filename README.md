# Hello, I'm Nisha 

## About Me ðŸŒ±   

I'm a software engineer who loves solving problems with code, fueled by my daily dose of espresso. When I don't have my nose buried in a project, youâ€™ll find it buried in a book (*The Good Earth* by Pearl S. Buck is my favorite!). Otherwise, I'm exploring the outdoors on a hike, capturing moments on my trusty Fuji camera, or just disconnecting and taking a quaint walk. I love bringing ideas and designs to life and am always looking for the next adventureâ€”whether it's on foot or in Visual Studio!
