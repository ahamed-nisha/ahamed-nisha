# Hello, I'm Nisha    

## About Me  ðŸŒ±

I am an espresso-fueled software engineer based in NYC. I thrive on solving problems with code and love bringing ideas and designs to life, with a special passion for minimalism and creating clean, intuitive user interfaces. I strongly believe in the beauty of simplicity and that thoughtful design is key to delivering great digital experiences.

When Iâ€™m not buried in a project, youâ€™ll find me lost in a book (with The Good Earth by Pearl S. Buck as my all-time favorite!), exploring the outdoors on a hike, or capturing moments with my trusty Fuji camera. Whether itâ€™s on a nature trail or on Visual Studio, Iâ€™m always looking for the next adventure.
